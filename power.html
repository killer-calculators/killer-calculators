              The Gloaming has a cool-down of 10 seconds during Daytime and 4 seconds

          <li>SPECIAL INTERACTION: HIDING INSIDE LOCKERS</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              After teleporting to a Locker The Dredge sits inside it and can observe the
              environment outside.
            </li>
            <li>
              While there is no time limit to this, nearby Survivors will hear a warning
              sound after 8 seconds have elapsed.
            </li>
            <li>Press the Interaction button to exit the Locker.</li>
            <li>
              If The Dredge teleports into a Locker already occupied by a Survivor, it
              will trap the Survivor and emerge from the Locker carrying them.
            </li>
            <li>
              This also happens when a Survivor interacts with a Locker in any way that is
              already occupied by The Dredge.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>

        <ul class="list-power">
          <li>SPECIAL INTERACTION: LOCKING LOCKERS</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              All Lockers spawn with an open latch on their door that Survivors can
              interact with to close it and lock the door.
            </li>
            <li>
              Locked Lockers cannot be entered by Survivors and take priority when The
              Dredge teleports to them.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Dredge takes 2.25 seconds to open a Locked Locker from the inside,
              making a lot of noise in the process.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once The Dredge emerges from a Locked Locker, its lock is broken
              permanently.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Dredge can also break the lock from the outside by hitting it with a
              Basic Attack.
            </li>

          <li>SPECIAL AFFLICTION: NIGHTFALL</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Once the Nightfall Meter is full at 300 Charges, Nightfall begins and lasts
              for 60 seconds, forcing Survivors to navigate the environment in near-total
              darkness while The Dredge benefits from clearer vision and several effects:
            </li>
            <ul class="list-power-second-level">
              <li>Grants the Undetectable Status Effect</li>
              <li>Increases its Teleporation speed to 38 m/s</li>
              <li>Reduces the Cool-down duration of The Gloaming to 4 seconds</li>
              <li>
                Survivors trigger Killer Instinct within 16 metres of Lockers occupied by
                The Dredge or The Remnant upon returning to it.
              </li>
            </ul>
