      <p>
        SPECIAL ABILITY: DELUGE OF FEAR<br />
        The Dredge starts the Trial with 3 Tokens.<br />
        Press and hold the Power button to activate The Gloaming while leaving a Remnant
        behind:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduces its Movement speed to 3.8 m/s.</li>
        <li>
          Removes the ability to attack or interact with Survivors or interact with Props.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        SPECIAL LOCOMOTION: THE GLOAMING<br />
        While roaming the environment in this state, the auras of all lockers are revealed
        to The Dredge Press the Secondary Power button to consume 1 Token and teleport
        into any Locker at a speed of 19 m/s.<br />
        Press it again while inside a Locker to teleport into another Locker until all
        Tokens are consumed.<br />
        Press the Attack button to cancel The Gloaming and instantly return to the
        Remnant, if it is still available.<br />
        The Remnant is removed after the first teleport or when a Survivor collides with
        it.<br />
        The Gloaming has a cool-down of 10 seconds during Daytime and 4 seconds during
        Nightfall.
      </p>
      <p>
        SPECIAL INTERACTION: HIDING INSIDE LOCKERS<br />
        After teleporting to a Locker The Dredge sits inside it and can observe the
        environment outside.<br />
        While there is no time limit to this, nearby Survivors will hear a warning sound
        after 8 seconds have elapsed.<br />
        Press the Interaction button to exit the Locker.<br />
        If The Dredge teleports into a Locker already occupied by a Survivor, it will trap
        the Survivor and emerge from the Locker carrying them.
        <br />This also happens when a Survivor interacts with a Locker in any way that is
        already occupied by The Dredge.
      </p>
      <p>
        SPECIAL INTERACTION: LOCKING LOCKERS<br />
        All Lockers spawn with an open latch on their door that Survivors can interact
        with to close it and lock the door.<br />
        Locked Lockers cannot be entered by Survivors and take priority when The Dredge
        teleports to them.<br />
        The Dredge takes 2.25 seconds to open a Locked Locker from the inside, making a
        lot of noise in the process.<br />
        Once The Dredge emerges from a Locked Locker, its lock is broken permanently.<br />
        The Dredge can also break the lock from the outside by hitting it with a Basic
        Attack.
      </p>
      <p>
        SPECIAL AFFLICTION: NIGHTFALL<br />
        Once the Nightfall Meter is full at 300 Charges, Nightfall begins and lasts for 60
        seconds, forcing Survivors to navigate the environment in near-total darkness
        while The Dredge benefits from clearer vision and several effects:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Grants the Undetectable Status Effect</li>
        <li>Increases its Teleporation speed to 38 m/s</li>
        <li>Reduces the Cool-down duration of The Gloaming to 4 seconds</li>
        <li>
          Survivors trigger Killer Instinct within 16 metres of Lockers occupied by The
          Dredge or The Remnant upon returning to it.
        </li>
      </ul>

          into a Trial
